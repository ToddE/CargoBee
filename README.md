**ConTetris** is a simple web-based logistics calculator designed to solve the common puzzle of optimally loading cargo into shipping containers. 

It accounts for **cargo weight**, **warehouse constraints**, and **multi-container shipments**, providing an actionable loading plan beyond simple volume calculations.

## ## Key Features

* **Dual Shipment Modes:** Calculates optimal loads for both **Palletized** and **Floor-Loaded** cargo.
* **Intelligent Palletization:** For palletized shipments, it generates a sophisticated mix of multi-height "Base" and "Topper" pallets to maximize cubic space while respecting warehouse height limits.
* **Weight & Volume Aware:** The algorithm validates the final plan against both the container's physical volume and the practical **road weight limits** (~44,000 lbs / 19,950 kg) to prevent overweight shipments.
* **Multi-Container Logic:** If a shipment is too large for any single container, ConTetris provides a smart, cost-effective recommendation of multiple containers (e.g., "1 x 40' HC & 1 x 20' Standard").
* **Persistent Profiles:** Save, name, load, and delete multiple shipment configurations directly in your browser's local storage for quick recall.
* **Shareable Calculations:** Generate a unique, transparent URL that pre-populates the calculator with your exact inputs, making it easy to share over email or text.

    * **Total Cartons & Weight:** The total number of cartons and the weight of a single carton.
    * **Dimensions:** Provide dimensions for your cartons and, if applicable, your pallets and maximum warehouse stacking height.
3.  **Calculate & Review:**
    * Click **"Calculate Optimal Load"**. The results pane will display the most efficient combination of containers.
    * Review the **Weight Status** to ensure your load is compliant with road limits.
    * Check the **Configuration Details** for a breakdown of how many pallets to build or a confirmation of the floor load.
4.  **Share or Save:**
    * Click **"Copy Shareable Link"** to get a URL that you can send to colleagues.
